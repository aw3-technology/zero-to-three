## Book Description

*Zero to Three* is the definitive guide for building successful ventures in the age of Web3 and AI. Inspired by Peter Thiel's "Zero to One," this book addresses the unique challenges and opportunities of decentralized technology and artificial intelligence.

The book presents a comprehensive framework for entrepreneurship that acknowledges how Web3 and AI represent fundamentally new technological paradigms requiring different approaches than traditional Silicon Valley startup methodologies.

## How to Use This Book

- Start where it hurts: jump to the chapter that matches your current bottleneck. Every chapter begins with “In This Chapter” and ends with a Checklist and Exercises.
- Skim intelligently: look for “Skim This” callouts to capture the gist in under five minutes.
- Follow the links: each chapter cross‑links to tools and case studies; use them for concrete patterns and anti‑patterns.
- Revisit by stage: as you move from Zero → One → Two → Three, different chapters become most relevant.

## Preface

This project is intentionally living: it updates as the landscape shifts. Contributions, critiques, and case studies are welcome, and governance follows open collaboration principles. Treat this as a practical playbook—use the checklists and exercises.

## Prologue

Why this book and why now: after successes and failures across AI and Web3, the most durable pattern was a shift from product‑centric thinking to system stewardship. The journey from Zero to Three is recursive—this book helps you know where you are and what to do next.
