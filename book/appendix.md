# APPENDICES

This section collects extended material to support practice and implementation. Use it as a companion to the core chapters—refer back as you iterate through Zero → One → Two → Three.

- Appendix A: Case Studies Compendium — real‑world examples mapped to themes and stages. See: [Case Studies Compendium](../case_studies.md)
- Appendix B: Tools and Resources — living list of frameworks, checklists, and references. (Coming soon)

Contributions welcome. If you have a case, tool, or framework that others could benefit from, propose an addition.
