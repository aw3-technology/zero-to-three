# Case Studies Compendium

Use these cases to deepen or challenge ideas from each chapter. Each item links a concrete story to a core concept so you can study patterns, not just anecdotes.

## Foundational Infrastructure & Developer Tools

### Alchemy
Developer infrastructure that abstracts blockchain node complexity and unlocks application velocity. Illustrates platform leverage and API-first ecosystems.

### Celestia
Modular blockchain architecture separating data availability from execution. Demonstrates innovation hierarchy and specialization at the infrastructure layer.

### Chainlink
Oracle networks for verifiable off-chain data. A trust engineering case: incentives, redundancy, and cryptographic guarantees.

### IPFS / Filecoin
Content-addressed storage and incentive-aligned persistence. Shows protocol design, public goods, and sustainable token sinks.

### Cosmos
Interoperability via IBC and sovereign chains. Model for standards, ecosystem leadership, and multi-chain governance.

### Bitcoin
Credible neutrality and conservative governance at planetary scale. Useful for long-term vision, incentives, and security design.

### NVIDIA / TSMC
Compute and fabrication moats. Economic fundamentals, capital intensity, and supply constraints as durable advantages.

## AI Foundations & Platforms

### OpenAI
From research to product and platform. System design, evals/safety, and platform economics.

### Anthropic
Constitutional AI and safety-by-design. Ethics-as-infrastructure and governance choices.

### DeepSeek
Open-weight models and sovereign AI. Global innovation geography and alternative development playbooks.

### Hugging Face
Open ecosystem for models/datasets/spaces. Community-as-platform and developer experience as moat.

## Creative AI & Tools

### Midjourney
Community-first product on Discord. Movement building, aesthetic identity, and distribution-as-community.

### Runway
Professional creative workflows for video. UX for power with safety and progressive disclosure.

### Luma Labs
3D creation via AI. Bridging research to accessible tools and creator business models.

### Wryter Inc.
Narrative design with AI collaboration. Domain-specific UX and human-in-the-loop.

## Applied AI & Social Impact

### Pangea Social
Privacy-preserving social with AI. Trust, identity, and moderation design.

### JustiGuide
AI for immigration justice. Mission alignment, risk management, and data ethics.

### ClimateBase
Mission-led community and talent network. Community building, rituals, and impact measurement.

## Financial and Crypto-Native Innovation

### Uniswap
AMM design, immutable contracts, and transparency. Trust engineering and protocol sustainability.

### Helium Network
Token incentives for real-world infrastructure. Tokenomics: work proofs, sinks, and fraud resistance.

### Nigeria’s Crypto Movement
Grassroots adoption under constraints. Emerging market innovation and leapfrogging.

### Nubank
LatAm digital banking at scale. Regulatory navigation, UX, and capital access.

### Polygon
India’s breakout Web3 infra. Standards, BD, and ecosystem development.

### FTX (Cautionary Tale)
Misgovernance and ethics failures. Trust-by-architecture over narratives; avoid concentration of control.

### The DAO Hack (Cautionary Tale)
Early governance and security lessons. Formal verification, upgrade paths, and crisis response.
