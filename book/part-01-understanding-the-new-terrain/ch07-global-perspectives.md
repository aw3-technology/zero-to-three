# Chapter 6: Global Perspectives

## Why Global Context Matters

Innovation patterns differ by culture, regulation, capital access, and infrastructure. Understanding these differences helps you prioritize markets, partnerships, and hiring—and avoid copying playbooks that won’t transfer.

## Regional Lenses (Quick Guide)

- United States: venture density, talent liquidity, regulatory fragmentation by state
- European Union: strong privacy, stable regulation, procurement-driven adoption
- Latin America: fintech leapfrogging, mobile-first consumers, unstable currencies
- Africa: mobile money leadership, grassroots crypto usage, infrastructure gaps
- India: cost-efficient engineering, fast digital public goods (UPI, Aadhaar)
- China: scale advantages, state alignment, tightening AI/data controls

## Go-To-Market Patterns By Region

- Distribution: partnerships beat ads; local champions matter
- Compliance: prioritize legal primitives (KYC, data residency, tax)
- Payments: offer local rails and FX transparency
- Community: language-specific content and local moderators

## Founder’s Checklist

- Which 2–3 regions fit our product-regulatory fit today?
- Do we have a local partner for compliance and distribution?
- What must be localized (UX, pricing, language, integrations)?
- How will we support 24/7 ops and community across time zones?

## Exercises

- Draft a one-page market entry plan for a target country
- Identify one anchor partner to unlock distribution or compliance
- Map a “minimum localization” scope for your product
