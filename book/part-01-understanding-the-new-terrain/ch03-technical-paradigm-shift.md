# Chapter 3: The Technical Paradigm Shift

## The Evolution of Computing Paradigms

From mainframes to personal computers, from desktop to mobile, and now from centralized to decentralized systems.

## Case Studies

### DeepSeek
*Open Innovation in AI*

DeepSeek represents a new model of AI development - transparent, open-source, and community-driven. Their approach challenges the closed development models of major AI labs, demonstrating how technical paradigm shifts often come from unexpected sources.

### FTX
*When Paradigm Shifts Go Wrong*

The FTX collapse serves as a cautionary tale about confusing technological innovation with financial engineering. While presenting itself as a paradigm shift in crypto trading, FTX's failure revealed the importance of genuine technical innovation over marketing narratives.

## Technical Foundations

- Blockchain as a trust machine
- Smart contracts as programmable money
- Decentralized consensus mechanisms
- The shift from client-server to peer-to-peer architectures

## In This Chapter, You Will

- Recognize the primitives driving the current shift
- Map how these primitives change system design choices
- Avoid hype: separate infrastructure from applications
- Identify a practical experiment to run in your domain

## Founder’s Checklist

- Do we need a blockchain—or just a database with signatures?
- What assumptions break if an AI agent is the user?
- Which parts must be open/standard vs. closed/defensible?
- How will we verify integrity, provenance, and intent?

## Exercises

- Redesign one core flow assuming AI agents are first-class users
- Diagram your trust model: who/what must you verify and how?
- Choose one decentralization you can credibly adopt in 90 days
