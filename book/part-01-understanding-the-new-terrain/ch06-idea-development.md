## Subtitle: Creating Defensible Advantages

## Building Moats in Open Systems

How to create competitive advantages when code is open source and forkable.

## Case Studies

### n8n
*Open Source Business Model*

n8n demonstrates how to build defensible advantages in workflow automation through community, integrations, and enterprise features. Despite being open source, they've created a sustainable business model through:

## In This Chapter, You Will

- Generate and evaluate ideas with explicit defensibility
- Identify moats suitable for open systems (standards, ecosystem, DX)
- Avoid cargo-cult “moats” that don’t survive first contact
- Design a fast path from insight → prototype → external proof

## Founder’s Checklist

- What’s our non-obvious insight and why now?
- Which moat fits our layer: data, distribution, network, switching cost?
- What must be open to grow, and what must be closed to defend?
- Who benefits alongside us if we win (positive-sum narrative)?

## Exercises

- Write a one-page “moat memo” for your top idea
- Design a test for one moat (e.g., distribution partnership pilot)
- Draft an RFC for a standard that would lock-in developer mindshare

- Network effects from community-built integrations
- Enterprise-specific features and support
- Brand recognition and trust
- Developer ecosystem and marketplace

## Types of Defensible Advantages in Web3

1. **Network Effects**: Liquidity, users, developers
2. **Brand and Trust**: Reputation in a trustless world
3. **Community**: Governance tokens and aligned incentives
4. **Technical Excellence**: Performance, security, innovation speed
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Being the compliant option
6. **Ecosystem Lock-in**: Integrations and composability
