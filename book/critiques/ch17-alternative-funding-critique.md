# Critique â€” Chapter 17: Alternative Funding

Source: part-03-one-building-systems/ch17-alternative-funding.md

## Strengths
- Surveys non-traditional financing (grants, retrofunding, protocol incentives).

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs decision criteria and runway math; compliance risks underplayed.
- Lacks examples with timelines and dilution/economic impact.

## Suggestions
- Add side-by-side comparison with worked scenarios (equity, grants, tokens, rev-share).
- Provide milestone-based grant roadmap; add reporting templates.
- Include jurisdictional notes and legal disclaimers.

## Cross-links
- Ch4 Economic Fundamentals; Appendix (legal resources).

## Action Items
- Add comparisons; add templates; add jurisdiction notes.
