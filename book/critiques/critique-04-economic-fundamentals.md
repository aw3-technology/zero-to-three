# Critique â€” Chapter 4: Economic Fundamentals

Source: part-01-understanding-the-new-terrain/ch04-economic-fundamentals.md

## Strengths
- Frames unit economics and incentive design as first-class.
- Acknowledges market cycles and liquidity regimes.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs specific models for token vs. equity vs. hybrid financing.
- Lacks sensitivity analysis for key drivers (retention, CAC, emission schedules).

## Suggestions
- Include worked examples: cohort LTV under different fee splits; token sink/source flows.
- Add a simple Monte Carlo or scenario grid for emissions vs. runway vs. growth.
- Clarify compliance constraints and region-by-region differences at a high level.

## Cross-links
- Ch17 Alternative Funding; Ch22 Decentralized Governance.

## Figure Idea
- Sankey of value flows among actors (users, validators, devs, treasury).

## Action Items
- Add 2 worked examples; add scenario grid; add compliance notes.
