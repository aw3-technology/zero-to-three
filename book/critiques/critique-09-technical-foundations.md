# Critique â€” Chapter 9: Technical Foundations

Source: part-02-zero-the-founders-journey/ch09-technical-foundations.md

## Strengths
- Frames architecture decisions early; considers data/model/security.
- Encourages pragmatic build vs. buy vs. partner choices.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs concrete reference architectures (centralized, hybrid, decentralized).
- Missing cost/capacity planning (compute, bandwidth, on-chain ops).

## Suggestions
- Add 3 reference diagrams with tradeoffs and when-to-use.
- Include cost worksheet template; add SLOs and reliability targets by stage.
- Briefly cover compliance-by-design (PII, KYC/AML, model risk management).

## Cross-links
- Ch3 Technical Paradigm Shift; Ch21 AI System Design.

## Action Items
- Add diagrams; add cost worksheet; add SLO table; add compliance notes.
