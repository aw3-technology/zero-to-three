Source: part-01-understanding-the-new-terrain/ch02-evolution-of-entrepreneurship.md

## Strengths
- Useful historical arc; situates Zero→Three among prior models.
- Highlights shift from firm-centric to network-centric creation.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs clearer taxonomy of org forms (startup, protocol, DAO, coop, open-source).
- Risk of Western bias; global variations underexplored.

## Suggestions
- Add a comparison table: value creation modes across eras (capex, margins, coordination tech).
- Include 2 non-US examples (e.g., India UPI stack; LATAM fintech + crypto rails).
- Clarify boundary conditions where traditional firms outperform networks.

## Cross-links
- Ch6 Global Perspectives; Ch29 Building Movements.

## Figure Idea
- Matrix of organizational models vs. coordination/incentive primitives.

## Action Items
- Add table; add 2 global mini-cases; define org taxonomy.
