# Critique — Chapter 13: System Thinking

Source: part-03-one-building-systems/ch13-system-thinking.md

## Strengths
- Correctly emphasizes feedback loops and second-order effects.
- Encourages model-based reasoning over linear plans.

## Gaps and Risks
- Abstract; needs concrete product/system examples with measures.
- Missing failure analysis (unintended incentives, governance drift).

## Suggestions
- Add 2 system maps (causal loop diagrams) for real features/incentives.
- Provide a small toolkit: assumptions log, systems notebook, A/B guardrails.
- Include a “beware Goodhart’s law” sidebar with mitigation patterns.

## Cross-links
- Ch22 Decentralized Governance; Ch29 Building Movements.

## Action Items
- Add diagrams; add toolkit artifacts; add Goodhart sidebar.
