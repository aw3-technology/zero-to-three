# Critique — Chapter 14: Technology Decisions

Source: part-03-one-building-systems/ch14-technology-decisions.md

## Strengths
- Frames decisions as reversible vs. one-way-door; emphasizes latency/cost/reliability.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs decision records (ADRs) and evaluation checklists.
- Missing vendor lock-in and exit strategy considerations.

## Suggestions
- Add ADR template; include evaluation matrix with weighted criteria.
- Provide “no-regrets” defaults per stack layer; outline de-risking pilots.
- Document exit plans and data portability for each critical dependency.

## Cross-links
- Ch9 Technical Foundations; Appendix for templates.

## Action Items
- Add ADRs; add matrix; add exit plans.
