Source: part-04-two-scaling-systems/ch21-ai-system-design.md

## Strengths
- Covers model choice, data strategy, and evaluation importance.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs rigorous eval taxonomy (offline, online, adversarial); governance absent.
- Sparse treatment of safety, privacy, and provenance.

## Suggestions
- Add eval framework with example metrics and acceptance thresholds.
- Cover data governance: lineage, consent, retention, redaction, synthetic data.
- Include model risk management checklist and incident response for AI failures.

## Cross-links
- Ch9 Technical Foundations; Appendix (evaluation templates).

## Action Items
- Add eval framework; add data governance; add risk checklist.
