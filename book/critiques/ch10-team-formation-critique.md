# Critique — Chapter 10: Team Formation

Source: part-02-zero-the-founders-journey/ch10-team-formation.md

## Strengths
- Emphasizes complementarity across product, go-to-market, and technical depth.
- Notes importance of contributor pathways in networked orgs.

## Gaps and Risks
- Equity/token comp frameworks are vague; roles for community contributors unclear.
- Underdeveloped section on culture and decision rights in distributed teams.

## Suggestions
- Add compensation bands and vesting models (equity, tokens, hybrids) with scenarios.
- Provide operating cadence template (rituals, RFCs, on-chain votes, off-chain forums).
- Include “roles to hire first” archetypes by venture type.

## Cross-links
- Ch29 Building Movements; Appendix for templates.

## Action Items
- Add comp frameworks; add cadence template; add early hire archetypes.
