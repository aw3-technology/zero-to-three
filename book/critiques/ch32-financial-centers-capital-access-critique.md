## Strengths
- Addresses shifting geography of capital and liquidity.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs concrete data on flows, costs, and instruments by hub.
- Underplays regulatory routes and cross-border constraints.

## Suggestions
- Add hub profiles (e.g., Dubai, Singapore, London, NY) with pros/cons and costs.
- Provide financing paths per company type; include example timelines.
- Include compliance pathways and banking/fiat access playbooks.

## Cross-links
- Ch4 Economic Fundamentals; Ch17 Alternative Funding.

## Action Items
- Add hub profiles; add financing paths; add compliance playbooks.
