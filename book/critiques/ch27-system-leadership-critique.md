# Critique — Chapter 27: System Leadership

Source: part-05-three-leading-systems/ch27-system-leadership.md

## Strengths
- Stresses multi-stakeholder alignment and long-termism.

## Gaps and Risks
- Overlaps with Ch25; needs sharper definition and scope.
- Missing crisis leadership and legitimacy maintenance under stress.

## Suggestions
- Differentiate system vs. ecosystem leadership with decision rights and scope.
- Add crisis case study (e.g., contentious fork, security incident) with playbook.
- Provide “values into policy” mapping for hard tradeoffs.

## Cross-links
- Ch11 When Everything Breaks; Ch22 Governance.

## Action Items
- Clarify scope; add crisis playbook; add values→policy mapping.
