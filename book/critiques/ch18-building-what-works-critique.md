# Critique — Chapter 18: Building What Works

Source: part-03-one-building-systems/ch18-building-what-works.md

## Strengths
- Emphasizes iterative delivery tied to real signals.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs explicit “thin slice” strategies for AI and on-chain products.
- Missing guardrails for shipping under governance constraints.

## Suggestions
- Add MVP patterns: model-in-the-loop, human-in-the-loop, verifiable claims.
- Include deployment checklist (evals, observability, rollback, governance notices).
- Provide examples of defining “works” metrics per product type.

## Cross-links
- Ch8 Market Validation; Ch21 AI System Design; Ch22 Governance.

## Action Items
- Add patterns; add deployment checklist; add metrics examples.
