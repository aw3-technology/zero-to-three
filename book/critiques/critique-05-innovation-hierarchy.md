# Critique — Chapter 5: Innovation Hierarchy

Source: part-01-understanding-the-new-terrain/ch05-innovation-hierarchy.md

## Strengths
- Useful stratification (infrastructure → platform → application → ecosystem).
- Encourages thinking about leverage points and defensibility.

## Gaps and Risks
- Terms overlap with other frameworks; definitions need sharpening.
- Missing pitfalls section (e.g., premature platformization, over-tokenization).

## Suggestions
- Define each layer with crisp entry/exit criteria and example metrics.
- Add “anti-patterns” subsection with short case snippets.
- Map roles across Zero→Three stages at each layer.

## Cross-links
- Ch18 Building What Works; Ch25 Ecosystem Leadership.

## Figure Idea
- Pyramid with feedback arrows showing recursion and spillovers.

## Action Items
- Tighten definitions; add anti-patterns; add layer↔stage mapping.
