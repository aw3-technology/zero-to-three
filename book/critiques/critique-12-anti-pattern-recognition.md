Source: part-02-zero-the-founders-journey/ch12-anti-pattern-recognition.md

## Strengths
- Valuable focus on common failure modes.
- Helps founders build pattern literacy early.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs clear evidence or exemplars for each anti-pattern.
- Risk of overgeneralization without context or stage nuance.

## Suggestions
- Define 6–8 anti-patterns with “signals” and “countermoves”.
- Add short anonymized caselets; specify stage applicability and exceptions.
- Provide a self-audit checklist and quarterly review cadence.

## Cross-links
- Ch8 Market Validation; Ch18 Building What Works.

## Action Items
- Add caselets; add signals/countermoves; add self-audit.
