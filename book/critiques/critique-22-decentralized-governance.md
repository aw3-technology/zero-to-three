# Critique â€” Chapter 22: Decentralized Governance

Source: part-04-two-scaling-systems/ch22-decentralized-governance.md

## Strengths
- Frames governance as product; recognizes tradeoffs in decentralization.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs explicit mechanisms (delegation, quorum, conviction voting, councils).
- Underdeveloped incentive compatibility and capture-resistance discussion.

## Suggestions
- Add mechanism toolkit with when-to-use and failure modes.
- Include case studies of upgrades/treasury, including post-mortems.
- Provide progressive decentralization roadmap with milestones and metrics.

## Cross-links
- Ch29 Building Movements; Ch25 Ecosystem Leadership.

## Action Items
- Add toolkit; add cases; add roadmap with metrics.
