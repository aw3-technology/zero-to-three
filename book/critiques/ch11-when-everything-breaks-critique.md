Source: part-02-zero-the-founders-journey/ch11-when-everything-breaks.md

## Strengths
- Realistic treatment of failure modes and ambiguity.
- Encourages pre-mortems and resilience practices.

## Gaps and Risks
- Missing incident response playbooks (security, downtime, governance crises).
- Light on mental health and founder durability practices.

## Suggestions
- Include incident templates (SEV levels, comms, rollback, chain reorg response).
- Add resilience toolkit: sleep, therapy, cofounder contracts, decision journals.
- Provide “kill criteria” checklist and pivot decision framework.

## Cross-links
- Ch22 Decentralized Governance (crisis governance); Ch17 funding contingencies.

## Action Items
- Add incident templates; add resilience toolkit; add kill criteria.
