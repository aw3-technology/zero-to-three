# Critique — Chapter 3: Technical Paradigm Shift

Source: part-01-understanding-the-new-terrain/ch03-technical-paradigm-shift.md

## Strengths
- Identifies key primitives (scaling, data, models, verifiable state).
- Bridges infrastructure shifts to product/market consequences.

## Gaps and Risks
- Missing concrete performance/cost curves (e.g., $/token, TPS, finality, storage).
- Shallow on privacy and data provenance tradeoffs.

## Suggestions
- Add cost/performance charts (as of 2025‑Q1) with sources.
- Cover privacy-preserving tech: ZK, TEEs, differential privacy; pros/cons.
- Include a decision tree for choosing infra (centralized, hybrid, decentralized) by constraint.

## Cross-links
- Ch21 AI System Design; Ch22 Decentralized Governance; Appendix for sources.

## Figure Idea
- Layered stack diagram: compute, data, model, application, governance.

## Action Items
- Add 3 referenced charts; add decision tree; add privacy section.
