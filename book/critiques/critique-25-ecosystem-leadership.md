# Critique â€” Chapter 25: Ecosystem Leadership

Source: part-05-three-leading-systems/ch25-ecosystem-leadership.md

## Strengths
- Articulates shift from founder-as-controller to steward.
- Emphasizes standards, protocols, and enabling others.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs concrete governance-of-governance patterns; legitimacy pathways.
- Lacks economics of ecosystem sustainability (funding commons, grants, fees).

## Suggestions
- Add playbook: standards working groups, EIP/RFC processes, conflict resolution.
- Provide sustainability models (treasury mgmt, fees, public goods funding).
- Include KPIs for ecosystem health (dev velocity, third-party GDP, churn).

## Cross-links
- Ch22 Governance; Ch29 Building Movements.

## Action Items
- Add playbook; add sustainability models; add KPIs.
