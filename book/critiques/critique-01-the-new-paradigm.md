# Critique — Chapter 1: The New Paradigm

Source: part-01-understanding-the-new-terrain/ch01-the-new-paradigm.md

## Strengths
- Clear framing of macro transition; orients reader to scope and stakes.
- Connects AI × Web3 convergence with entrepreneurial implications.

## Gaps and Risks
- Lacks concrete indicators (metrics, timelines) distinguishing paradigm vs. cycle.
- Few counterpoints; risk of techno-optimism without constraints.

## Suggestions
- Add 3 hard signals (e.g., on-chain users, L2 throughput, AI inference costs over time).
- Include a brief “where this breaks” box: regulation, compute bottlenecks, talent constraints.
- Anchor with 1–2 micro-cases (startup pivots enabled by new primitives).

## Cross-links
- Link to Ch3 Technical Paradigm Shift and Ch22 Decentralized Governance.

## Figure Idea
- Timeline showing inflection points: scaling breakthroughs, protocol upgrades, AI cost curves.

## Action Items
- Add metrics table; add two case blurbs; add risk box.
