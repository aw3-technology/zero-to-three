# Critique — Chapter 7: Idea Development

Source: part-02-zero-the-founders-journey/ch07-idea-development.md

## Strengths
- Emphasizes asymmetric insight and founder–problem fit.
- Encourages rapid exploration over premature convergence.

## Gaps and Risks
- Lacks concrete exercises to generate/grade ideas.
- Missing examples of good vs. bad “AI/Web3 idea smells”.

## Suggestions
- Add a 7-day exploration sprint template (sources, interviews, artifacts).
- Include scoring rubric: contrarian truth, feasibility, moat, market pull.
- Provide 3 “idea smell” examples and fixes.

## Cross-links
- Ch9 Technical Foundations; Ch12 Anti-Pattern Recognition.

## Action Items
- Add sprint template; add rubric; add smell examples.
