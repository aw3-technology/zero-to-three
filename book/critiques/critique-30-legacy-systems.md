Source: part-05-three-leading-systems/ch30-legacy-systems.md

## Strengths
- Pragmatic focus on integrating with existing institutions and rails.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs concrete interoperability and compliance patterns.
- Underplays migration strategies and change management.

## Suggestions
- Add integration patterns (APIs, custodians, KYC providers, fiat ramps) with tradeoffs.
- Provide migration playbooks (data, contracts, user comms) and deprecation policies.
- Include case examples of hybrid deployments and staged unbundling.

## Cross-links
- Ch4 Economic Fundamentals; Ch23 Global Expansion.

## Action Items
- Add patterns; add migration playbooks; add case examples.
