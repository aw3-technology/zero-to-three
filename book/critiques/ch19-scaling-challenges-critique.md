Source: part-04-two-scaling-systems/ch19-scaling-challenges.md

## Strengths
- Identifies growth pain points across tech, org, and market.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs capacity planning and reliability targets; underplays ops debt.
- Sparse go-to-market scaling patterns by segment.

## Suggestions
- Add scaling playbooks: infra (SLOs, SRE), org (pods, DRI), GTM (ICP, channels).
- Include cost curves and hiring ramps; define “stall” diagnostics and remedies.
- Add “when to re-architect” criteria and runbooks.

## Cross-links
- Ch14 Technology Decisions; Ch23 Global Expansion.

## Action Items
- Add playbooks; add diagnostics; add re-architecture criteria.
