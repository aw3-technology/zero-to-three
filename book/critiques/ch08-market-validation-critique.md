# Critique â€” Chapter 8: Market Validation

Source: part-02-zero-the-founders-journey/ch08-market-validation.md

## Strengths
- Advocates evidence over conjecture; customer discovery focus.
- Notes traps of vanity metrics and crypto-native noise.

## Gaps and Risks
- Needs explicit validation ladders for B2B, B2C, and protocol use cases.
- Under-specifies how to validate governance demand vs. speculation.

## Suggestions
- Add stage-gated validation checklist (signal thresholds, timeboxes).
- Include 3 sample instruments: interview guide, landing test, on-chain metric cohorting.
- Distinguish speculative vs. utility demand using behavior patterns.

## Cross-links
- Ch18 Building What Works; Ch22 Decentralized Governance.

## Action Items
- Add ladders; add instruments; add demand distinction section.
