Legacy system integration is not about choosing sides between old and new paradigms—it's about building bridges that enable the best of both worlds. Success requires understanding that institutions move carefully and deliberately, but when they do move, they bring massive resources and credibility that can accelerate adoption far beyond what grassroots efforts alone can achieve.

The founders who master legacy integration become the connective tissue of the new economy, enabling mainstream adoption while preserving the revolutionary potential of decentralized technologies.
