# Acknowledgments

## To the Community That Made This Possible

This book exists because of the countless entrepreneurs, builders, and thinkers who have shared their insights, failures, and hard-won wisdom. The "Zero to Three" framework isn't the product of academic theorizing—it's distilled from real conversations with real people building real companies in the emerging Web3 and AI landscape.

### Founders Who Shared Their Stories

To the founders profiled in this book—from JustiGuide's mission-driven AI development to Nubank's transformation of Latin American finance—thank you for your transparency about both successes and struggles. Your willingness to share not just the highlight reels but the messy middle parts of building companies provides invaluable education for those following similar paths.

Special gratitude to the entrepreneurs who opened their books, their failures, and their private struggles to help others learn. Your vulnerability makes this entire ecosystem stronger.

### The Web3 and AI Communities

The decentralized nature of Web3 and the rapid evolution of AI create communities that are uniquely open to sharing knowledge. From Discord servers debating governance mechanisms to Twitter threads breaking down complex technical concepts, these communities embody the collaborative spirit that makes innovation possible.

Thank you to:
- The builders creating the infrastructure that enables everything else
- The researchers pushing the boundaries of what's possible
- The educators translating complex concepts for broader audiences
- The critics asking hard questions that make solutions stronger
- The community members providing feedback, support, and accountability

### Advisors and Mentors

To those who provided guidance during AW3's journey and the writing of this book: your questions were often more valuable than your answers. Thank you for challenging assumptions, pointing out blind spots, and helping refine ideas through rigorous conversation.

### The Open Source Movement

This book was written with the assistance of AI tools, hosted on open platforms, and designed to be freely shared and modified. It stands on the shoulders of countless developers who chose to make their work available for others to build upon.

The open source ethos—that knowledge grows when shared rather than hoarded—represents the best of human collaboration. This book aims to contribute to that tradition.

### Co-creation with AI

A unique aspect of this book is its collaboration with AI systems throughout the writing process. Rather than hiding this collaboration, we've chosen to be transparent about it as an example of human-AI partnership in action.

The AI didn't write this book—but it helped organize thoughts, suggest structures, catch inconsistencies, and explore ideas from angles I might not have considered alone. This partnership represents what we believe is the future of knowledge work: humans and AI systems working together to create value neither could achieve independently.

### Beta Readers and Early Community

To those who read early drafts, provided feedback, and helped refine ideas: your input transformed this from a collection of thoughts into a coherent framework. Thank you for your patience with rough edges and your suggestions for improvement.

### The Broader Entrepreneurship Ecosystem

While this book focuses on Web3 and AI, it builds on decades of entrepreneurship research, writing, and practice. From Peter Thiel's "Zero to One" to the countless books, articles, and conversations that have shaped understanding of innovation and venture building—thank you to all who have contributed to this body of knowledge.

### Family and Friends Who Supported the Journey

Entrepreneurship is often portrayed as an individual pursuit, but it's actually a team sport that extends far beyond co-founders and employees. To the family and friends who provided emotional support during the inevitable ups and downs, who listened to half-baked ideas, and who believed in the vision even when progress was slow: this wouldn't have been possible without you.

### The Future Contributors

This book is designed to be a living document that evolves with the ecosystem it describes. To those who will contribute improvements, corrections, case studies, and new frameworks: thank you in advance for making this resource better for future entrepreneurs.

## A Living Document

The "Zero to Three" framework will continue evolving as we learn more about building ventures in the Web3 and AI era. Your feedback, experiences, and contributions will help refine these ideas for future entrepreneurs navigating similar challenges.

If this book has been helpful, the best thanks you can give is to build something meaningful and share what you learn with others following behind you.
