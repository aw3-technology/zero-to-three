## Case Studies

### Hugging Face
*The GitHub of Machine Learning*

Hugging Face demonstrates sustainable open source through:

- **Community First**: Building the largest ML model repository
- **Freemium Model**: Free hosting with paid enterprise features
- **Ecosystem Value**: Becoming essential infrastructure for AI development
- **Network Effects**: Each model and dataset increases platform value

Their success shows how open source projects can build defensible businesses through community, convenience, and enterprise features.

### Uniswap
*Open Source DeFi Protocol*

Uniswap's approach to sustainable open source:

- **Immutable Contracts**: Core protocol cannot be changed
- **Fee Switch**: Governance-controlled protocol fees
- **Open Development**: All code publicly available
