# Chapter 4: Economic Fundamentals

## New Economic Models in Web3

Understanding tokenomics, network effects, and incentive alignment in decentralized systems.

## Case Studies

### Bitcoin
*The Original Economic Innovation*

Bitcoin represents the first successful implementation of digital scarcity and decentralized monetary policy. Its fixed supply cap, halving schedule, and proof-of-work consensus create an entirely new economic system that operates without central authority.

- Digital scarcity through cryptographic proof
- Incentive alignment between miners, users, and holders
- The economics of decentralized security

## Token Economics

- Utility vs. governance vs. security tokens
- Network value accrual mechanisms
- The economics of validators and delegators
- Fee markets and MEV (Maximum Extractable Value)
