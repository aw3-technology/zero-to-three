## Crisis Management and Resilience in Web3

Learning from failures and building antifragile systems.

## Case Studies

### FTX
*The Anatomy of Catastrophic Failure*

The FTX collapse provides critical lessons for the Web3 ecosystem:

- **Centralization Risk**: Despite crypto's decentralized ethos, FTX operated as a centralized entity with single points of failure
- **Governance Failures**: Lack of proper controls, board oversight, and risk management
- **Commingling of Funds**: Using customer deposits for proprietary trading
- **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Operating in jurisdictions with minimal oversight
- **Trust Misplacement**: The danger of personality cults in trustless systems

### Lessons for Builders

1. **Transparency**: On-chain proof of reserves
2. **Decentralization**: Removing single points of failure
3. **Risk Management**: Proper controls and governance
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Building sustainable, compliant businesses
5. **Community Oversight**: The importance of decentralized governance
