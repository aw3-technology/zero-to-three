# Prologue: The Path to AW3

## Will Schulz's Founder Journey

In 2013, I was broke, sleeping on a friend's couch in San Francisco, and completely convinced I was one brilliant idea away from building the next world-changing company. Like thousands of other ambitious twenty-somethings flooding into Silicon Valley, I believed the mythology: find a pain point, build a solution, raise money, scale fast, and change the world.

What I discovered instead was a brutal education in the gap between entrepreneurial dreams and reality.

### Personal Background in Computer Science and Economics

My academic foundation at UC Santa Barbara gave me the tools to analyze systems—both technological and economic. Computer science taught me to think in algorithms and data structures, while economics provided frameworks for understanding human behavior at scale. But nothing in those lecture halls prepared me for the emotional volatility and existential uncertainty of entrepreneurship.

The theoretical models I'd studied assumed rational actors operating in efficient markets. Reality proved messier: brilliant engineers building products no one wanted, profitable businesses that couldn't raise capital, and technically inferior solutions winning through superior marketing and timing.

### Early Career in Silicon Valley Business Intelligence

My first startup job was at a business intelligence company during the "big data" boom of the early 2010s. We promised to turn data into insights, but most of our enterprise clients couldn't even define what questions they wanted answered. I learned that having the right technology doesn't matter if you can't bridge the gap between capability and adoption.

This pattern would repeat throughout my career: the technology was never the bottleneck. Understanding users, building trust, creating sustainable business models, and navigating the human elements of innovation—these proved far more challenging than any technical problem.

### Disillusionment with the Startup Meritocracy Myth

Silicon Valley's culture promised that good ideas and hard work would be rewarded. The reality was more complex. Success depended heavily on network access, timing, and often pure luck. Some of the smartest people I knew couldn't raise money for objectively better solutions, while entrepreneurs with the right connections secured funding for concepts that seemed questionable at best.

This wasn't just unfair—it was inefficient. Great ideas were dying because their creators lacked access to the right conversations, while inferior concepts received millions in funding based on founder pedigree and presentation skills.

### Learning Painful Lessons Through Multiple Startup Attempts

Between 2013 and 2020, I launched or joined four different startups. Each failed, but each failure taught me something essential:

**Attempt #1** (2013): A consumer app for restaurant discovery. We built elegant technology but never achieved product-market fit. Users loved the experience but didn't change their behavior. I learned that user delight doesn't automatically translate to user retention.

**Attempt #2** (2015): An enterprise SaaS tool for team collaboration. We solved a real problem but couldn't compete with incumbents who had deeper distribution channels. I learned that being better isn't enough—you need to be dramatically better or find a different path to market.

**Attempt #3** (2017): A fintech startup focused on cryptocurrency payments. We were early to market but too early—the infrastructure wasn't ready, and regulatory clarity was nonexistent. I learned about timing and how being first can be worse than being best.

**Attempt #4** (2019): An AI-powered content creation platform. We achieved initial traction but couldn't scale the human elements required to make the AI truly valuable. I learned that automation amplifies human judgment—it doesn't replace the need for it.

### Going Broke as Entrepreneurial Initiation

By 2020, I had depleted my savings, maxed out credit cards, and was living paycheck-to-paycheck doing consulting work. Friends with traditional careers had bought houses, gotten married, and achieved financial stability while I was still chasing the entrepreneurial dream.

This financial pressure created a crucible. Either I would figure out how to build sustainable businesses, or I would abandon entrepreneurship altogether. The luxury of pursuing interesting problems without regard for revenue had disappeared.

Paradoxically, this constraint improved my thinking. I couldn't afford to work on anything that didn't have a clear path to profitability. I became ruthlessly focused on solving problems people would pay for, rather than problems that were intellectually interesting but commercially dubious.

### The Battle Royale of Intelligence

Silicon Valley attracts some of the world's most intelligent people. Walking into any coffee shop in Palo Alto, you're surrounded by PhDs from Stanford, former Google engineers, and Harvard MBAs all working on their revolutionary ideas. The intellectual competition is intimidating.

I realized that raw intelligence, while necessary, wasn't sufficient. The most successful entrepreneurs I met weren't necessarily the smartest people in the room—they were the ones who best understood how to channel intelligence toward solving real problems for real people.

This insight led me to focus less on trying to be the smartest person in the room and more on being the most useful. Instead of competing on pure intellectual firepower, I began competing on judgment, taste, and the ability to synthesize insights from different domains.

### The Founding Story of AW3 Technology in 2022

By 2022, two trends had converged that created a unique opportunity:

1. **AI capabilities had reached practical utility** for real applications beyond tech demos
2. **Web3 infrastructure had matured** enough to support genuine innovation beyond speculation

Most people saw these as separate trends. I saw them as complementary technologies that could solve each other's limitations: AI could make Web3 more accessible to mainstream users, while Web3 could make AI systems more transparent and equitable.

AW3 Technology emerged from this synthesis—not as a single product company, but as a venture studio focused on building the intersection of artificial intelligence and Web3 technologies.

### The Andromeda Web3 Metaphor

The name "Andromeda Web3" reflects our core philosophy: just as the Andromeda galaxy will eventually collide and merge with the Milky Way, creating something entirely new, we believe AI and Web3 are on a collision course that will fundamentally transform how we think about ownership, intelligence, and value creation.

This isn't just technological convergence—it's the emergence of new economic and social structures that transcend the limitations of centralized platforms and extractive business models.

### The Birth of the Proof of Love Blockchain Concept

Traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms optimize for security and scalability, but they don't optimize for human flourishing. Proof of Work consumes enormous energy. Proof of Stake concentrates power among the wealthy. Both systems are ultimately adversarial.

Our "Proof of Love" concept explores consensus mechanisms that reward positive-sum behaviors: sharing knowledge, supporting others, building useful things, and contributing to community wellbeing. Instead of competing for scarce resources, participants collaborate to expand what's possible for everyone.

This isn't just idealism—it's pragmatism. Sustainable systems must align individual incentives with collective benefit. The most successful Web3 projects will be those that create genuine value for all participants, not just early adopters and token holders.

### The Three-Pronged Approach as a Venture Studio

AW3 operates as a venture studio with three complementary functions:

1. **Internal Ventures**: We build our own products at the intersection of AI and Web3
2. **Advisory Services**: We help other founders navigate the complexities of these emerging technologies
3. **Educational Content**: We share what we learn through writing, speaking, and community building

This approach allows us to stay close to real problems while building solutions, relationships, and understanding simultaneously. Each function reinforces the others, creating a flywheel of learning and value creation.

### Why "Zero to Three" Matters Now More Than Ever

The traditional startup playbook—find a problem, build a solution, scale quickly—was designed for a world of centralized platforms and extractive business models. In the Web3 and AI era, success requires different approaches:

- **Personal mastery** before attempting to lead others
- **Product excellence** that solves genuine problems
- **Community building** that distributes rather than concentrates value
- **Systems thinking** that creates platforms for others to innovate

The "Zero to Three" framework emerged from years of making mistakes and observing patterns across successful and failed ventures. It's not just a business methodology—it's a philosophy for building technology that serves human potential rather than just maximizing metrics.

The entrepreneurs who will thrive in the coming decade won't be those who extract the most value from existing systems, but those who build new systems that expand what's possible for everyone.

This book represents everything I wish someone had told me when I was sleeping on that couch in 2013, convinced I was one brilliant idea away from changing the world. The truth is more complex and more interesting: changing the world requires changing yourself first, then building products that actually work, then fostering communities that want to use them, and finally creating systems that enable others to build on what you've started.

That journey from zero to three isn't just about building a successful company. It's about becoming the kind of person who can build companies worthy of success.
