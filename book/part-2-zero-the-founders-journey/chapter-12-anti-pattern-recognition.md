# Chapter 12: Anti-Pattern Recognition

## Learning from Failures in Web3

Identifying and avoiding common pitfalls in decentralized systems.

## Case Studies

### The DAO Hack
*The Original Smart Contract Disaster*

The DAO hack of 2016 remains one of the most important events in Ethereum's history:

- **The Vision**: A decentralized autonomous organization for venture funding
- **The Vulnerability**: Reentrancy attack allowing recursive withdrawals
- **The Impact**: $60 million stolen, Ethereum hard fork, creation of Ethereum Classic
- **The Lessons**:
  - Code is law until it isn't
  - The importance of formal verification
  - Community governance in crisis
  - The tension between immutability and pragmatism

## Common Anti-Patterns

1. **Over-Centralization**: Single points of failure in "decentralized" systems
2. **Complexity Creep**: Over-engineering smart contracts
3. **Governance Theater**: Centralized control with decentralized aesthetics
4. **Token First Design**: Creating tokens without clear utility
5. **Security Through Obscurity**: Assuming complexity provides security
6. **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Building on legal gray areas
