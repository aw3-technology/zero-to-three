# Chapter 22: Decentralized Governance

## Governing Evolving, Open Systems

Designing governance that is legible, adaptable, and resistant to capture.

## In This Chapter, You Will

- Define scope and powers for governance that won’t stall builders
- Separate technical from social change with clear processes
- Choose representation and quorum that prevent apathy/capture
- Stage governance maturity as adoption grows

## Founder’s Checklist

- What changes require governance vs. maintainer decision?
- How can non‑token contributions earn voice or reputation?
- Do we have emergency powers with tight limits and sunsets?
- Are proposals legible with impact, costs, and alternatives?

## Exercises

- Draft a minimal governance constitution (scope, roles, process)
- Define a reputation rubric tied to verifiable contributions
- Add a “request for discussion” (RFD/RFC) process and template
