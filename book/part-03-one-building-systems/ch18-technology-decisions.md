# Chapter 18: Technology Decisions

## 1. Introduction: Decisions That Define Your Future

Technology decisions are among the most consequential choices founders make, yet they're often made hastily, based on personal preferences, or by copying what successful companies have done without understanding the context. The wrong technology choices can sink a company—creating technical debt that becomes insurmountable, missing critical performance requirements, or locking you into proprietary systems that prevent future flexibility.

In the Web3 and AI era, these decisions become even more critical. The technology landscape shifts rapidly, new paradigms emerge regularly, and the cost of switching can be enormous once you've built significant infrastructure and processes around initial choices.

This chapter provides frameworks for making technology decisions that will serve your company well not just today, but as you scale from zero to three and beyond. We'll explore decision-making frameworks, common technology categories, evaluation criteria, and practical implementation strategies.

## 2. The Decision-Making Framework

### The Technology Decision Matrix

Every significant technology decision should be evaluated across five key dimensions:

**1. Technical Fit (25%)**
- Does this technology solve the core problem effectively?
- Will it handle your anticipated scale and performance requirements?
- How complex is the learning curve for your team?
- What are the technical limitations and trade-offs?

**2. Ecosystem Health (20%)**
- Is there an active community of developers and contributors?
- How frequently is the technology updated and maintained?
- What's the quality of documentation and learning resources?
- Are there skilled developers available for hiring?

**3. Business Alignment (20%)**
- Does this choice support your business model and monetization strategy?
- What are the licensing costs and fee structures?
- How does this affect your competitive positioning?
- Does it enable or constrain future business opportunities?

**4. Risk Management (20%)**
- What happens if this technology becomes obsolete or unsupported?
- How dependent does this make you on specific vendors or platforms?
- What are the migration costs if you need to change later?
- How does this affect security and compliance requirements?

**5. Team Capability (15%)**
- Does your team have expertise with this technology?
- How quickly can they become productive?
- What's the hiring market like for this skill set?
- How does this align with team preferences and career growth?

### Decision Documentation: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Every significant technology decision should be documented using Architecture Decision Records:

**ADR Template:**
```
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options did we look at?

## Implementation Timeline
When will this be implemented and what are the key milestones?
```

This documentation becomes invaluable when:
- New team members need to understand existing choices
- You're reconsidering decisions as requirements change
- You need to explain technical choices to investors or customers
- Similar decisions arise in the future

### ADR Example: Choosing Vector Database for Semantic Search

```
# ADR-007: Adopt pgvector on Postgres for Semantic Search

Status: Accepted

Context
We need approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for 768-dim embeddings to power RAG over ~5M documents. Options: Postgres + pgvector, Elasticsearch + k-NN, or a dedicated vector DB (Milvus/Weaviate).

Decision
Adopt Postgres with pgvector using IVF+PQ index on a dedicated read-replica.

Consequences
+ Single operational surface (Postgres) simplifies ops and backups
+ Strong transactional consistency for writes; easy joins to metadata
- ANN recall ~95–97% vs. specialized stores; requires tuning
- Potential write amplification during reindexing; need maintenance windows

Alternatives Considered
- Elasticsearch k-NN: strong ops story, but higher infra cost and separate cluster
- Milvus/Weaviate: great for scale; added ops burden and team learning curve
- In-memory FAISS per shard: fastest for niche cases; poor durability

Implementation Timeline
Week 1: prototype recall/latency targets, choose IVF/PQ params
Week 2: build ingestion and index maintenance jobs
Week 3: canary in production with dual-write shadow queries
Week 4: cutover, add monitoring (p99 latency, recall vs. truth set)
```

### Minimum Viable API Standard (Template)

Use this in repos exposing public/internal APIs (HTTP or gRPC).

```
# API Standard v0.1 (Service: Billing)

## Principles
- Backward compatibility first; additive changes preferred
- Idempotent, explicit, and observable
- Minimal surface; document non-goals

## Conventions
- Naming: snake_case for JSON fields; singular resource names
- Versioning: URI `/v1/...` (HTTP) or package `billing.v1` (gRPC)
- Auth: OAuth2 (user), PAT/service token (service); no implicit auth
- Idempotency: all write endpoints accept `Idempotency-Key`

## HTTP
- Media type: `application/json; charset=utf-8`
- Errors: RFC 7807 Problem+JSON `{type, title, status, detail, trace_id}`
- Pagination: cursor-based `{next_cursor, items: []}`; page size default 50, max 500
- Time: RFC 3339 UTC; money: ISO 4217 currency + integer minor units

## gRPC
- Deadlines required on all calls; server enforces max 30s
- Standard status codes; rich errors with `google.rpc.Status`

## Observability
- Trace: W3C trace context; propagate `traceparent`
- Logs: structured JSON, include `trace_id`, `user_id` (if available)
- Metrics: RED (rate, errors, duration) per endpoint; SLOs declared below

## Compatibility Policy
- Additive changes allowed anytime
- Breaking changes require `/v2` and 90-day deprecation notice

## Security
- Input validation at edge; reject unknown fields
- PII handling documented per field; encryption at rest + in transit
- Audit log for privileged actions (who, what, when, from where)

## SLOs
- Availability 99.9%; p99 latency: read <200ms, write <400ms
- Error budget policy: 25% of budget triggers feature freeze
```

## 3. Reference Architectures and Trade-offs

### Reference Architecture 1: Centralized Architecture

```

**When to Use:**

50% - 25%             | Reliability sprint, pause risky deployments  
25% - 0%              | Feature freeze, all hands on reliability

## Key Takeaways

### Technology Decisions are Business Decisions

Every technology choice has business implications—affecting development speed, operational costs, hiring requirements, and competitive positioning. Always evaluate technology decisions through the lens of business impact, not just technical merit.

### Document Everything

Architecture Decision Records aren't just bureaucracy—they're essential for scaling engineering organizations. Future team members (and future you) will thank you for explaining the context and trade-offs behind major decisions.

### Start Simple, Evolve Deliberately

The best architecture for a 10-person startup is different from the best architecture for a 100-person company. Design for your current scale while maintaining flexibility to evolve.

### Embrace Constraints

Constraints force good decisions. Set clear boundaries around technology choices, budget limits, and complexity levels. These constraints will guide better decision-making and prevent over-engineering.

### Plan for Change

The only constant in technology is change. Build systems that can evolve, maintain data portability, and regularly review and update your technology choices as business requirements change.

Technology decisions shape everything that follows in your company's journey. By approaching them systematically, documenting them thoroughly, and reviewing them regularly, you'll build the technical foundation needed to scale from zero to three and beyond.
