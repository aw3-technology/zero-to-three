# Chapter 18: Alternative Funding

## 1. Introduction: Beyond Traditional Venture Capital

New mechanisms for funding innovation in Web3.

## Case Studies

### Uniswap
*Protocol-Owned Liquidity and Community Funding*

Uniswap revolutionized funding through:

- **No VC Round**: Launched without traditional funding
- **Protocol Fees**: Sustainable revenue through trading fees
- **Retroactive Airdrop**: Rewarding early users and liquidity providers
- **Treasury Management**: DAO-controlled funds for development
- **Grants Program**: Funding ecosystem development

Their model proves that successful protocols can bootstrap without traditional capital, aligning incentives between users, developers, and token holders.
