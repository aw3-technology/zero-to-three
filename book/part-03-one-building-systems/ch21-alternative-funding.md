# Chapter 18: Alternative Funding

## 1. Introduction: Beyond Traditional Venture Capital

New mechanisms for funding innovation in Web3.

## Case Studies

### Uniswap
*Protocol-Owned Liquidity and Community Funding*

Uniswap revolutionized funding through:

- **No VC Round**: Launched without traditional funding
- **Protocol Fees**: Sustainable revenue through trading fees
- **Retroactive Airdrop**: Rewarding early users and liquidity providers
- **Treasury Management**: DAO-controlled funds for development
- **Grants Program**: Funding ecosystem development

Their model proves that successful protocols can bootstrap without traditional capital, aligning incentives between users, developers, and token holders.

## In This Chapter, You Will

- Compare equity, revenue share, grants, tokens, and hybrids
- Align instrument choice with product and community strategy
- Build credible use‑of‑funds with survival and growth scenarios
- Avoid common legal and incentive pitfalls

## Founder’s Checklist

- What does our instrument incentivize (and disincentivize)?
- How much runway do we really need for the next milestone?
- Which non‑dilutive sources have we actually pursued?
- Are we over‑promising governance, yields, or timelines?

## Funding Mechanism Comparison: Worked Scenarios

**Scenario: $500K needed for 18-month MVP development**

| **Mechanism** | **Timeline** | **Dilution** | **Control** | **Runway Impact** | **Best For** |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Seed VC** | 3-6 months | 15-25% equity | Board seats | $500K cash | Product-market fit focus |
| **Ecosystem Grants** | 1-3 months | 0% | Full control | $50-150K total | Infrastructure/public goods |
| **Token Pre-sale** | 2-4 months | 5-15% tokens | Community governance | $200-500K | Network effects needed |
| **Revenue Share** | 1-2 months | 0% equity | Full control | $100-300K | Proven revenue model |
| **Bootstrapping** | Immediate | 0% | Full control | Personal runway | Technical expertise available |

**Worked Example - DeFi Protocol:**
- **Grant Path:** Ethereum Foundation ($50K) + Protocol Labs ($75K) + Venture DAO ($100K) = $225K over 12 months
- **Equity Path:** $500K at $2M pre-money = 20% dilution, 18 months runway
- **Token Path:** 10% token allocation at launch, potential $1M+ if successful adoption
