## Content Guidelines and Standards

### Writing Style
- **Tone**: Authoritative yet accessible, similar to "Zero to One" but focused on Web3/AI
- **Length**: Chapters typically 4,000-6,000 words
- **Structure**: Clear section headers, practical examples, actionable takeaways
- **Audience**: Assumes technical literacy but explains Web3/AI concepts clearly

### Chapter Structure Template
1. **Introduction**: Hook and chapter overview
2. **Core Content**: 3-5 major sections with subsections
3. **Case Studies**: Real-world examples illustrating key points
4. **Implementation Guide**: Practical steps for readers
5. **Key Takeaways**: Bulleted summary of main insights

### Key Themes to Emphasize
- **Paradigm Shift**: Web3/AI requires fundamentally different approaches
- **Community-Centric**: Importance of decentralized communities over traditional customers
- **Token Economics**: How tokenomics shapes behavior and value creation
- **Psychological Challenges**: Mental health and cognitive aspects of frontier tech
- **Anti-Patterns**: What NOT to do based on Web2 thinking
- **Global Innovation**: Innovation happening beyond Silicon Valley

### Case Study Integration
- Use real companies and examples where possible
- Balance successful and failed examples
- Include technical details but keep accessible
- Connect to broader strategic themes
- Cite specific data points and outcomes

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### When Working on Chapters
1. **Read existing chapters** to understand voice, style, and depth
2. **Reference the chapter outlines** for structure and key points
3. **Maintain consistency** with established themes and terminology
4. **Include practical examples** and actionable advice
5. **End with clear takeaways** that readers can implement

### Content Development Process
1. **Understand the outline** - Read the provided chapter outline carefully
