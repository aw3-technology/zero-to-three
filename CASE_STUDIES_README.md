## Key Principles

‚úÖ **Balance**: Mix success stories with failures
‚úÖ **Diversity**: Include global perspectives
‚úÖ **Relevance**: Ensure cases directly support chapter themes
‚úÖ **Depth**: Primary cases (800-1000 words), supporting (200-300 words)
‚úÖ **Connection**: Reference cases across chapters for coherence

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Integrate suggested cases into Chapters 1-3
2. **Short-term**: Fill identified gaps (European cases, B2B SaaS)
3. **Ongoing**: Update cases with new developments quarterly
